    * photosynthesis  is  a  process  which plants  makes food  is called  photosynthesis.                                                             	*EQUATION of photosynthesis
			
 Water+carbondioxide-->chlorophyll in the presents of sunlight=carbhohydrates  +oxygen                          		
                                     Algae-type of plant
                      ->SLIMY green patches nearly  found in water surfaces.
                      ->Algae involves in photosynthesis and have chlorophyll.
          with the help of carbohydrates other nutrients .such as proteins are produced.
        ->carbohydrates contains carbon,hydrogen,oxygen,nitrogen.But proteiens needcarbon,
